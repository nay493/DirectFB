FusionSound README
------------------

   FusionSound is a very powerful audio sub system in the manner of DirectFB
   and a technical demonstration of Fusion.

   FusionSound supports multiple applications using Fusion IPC.
   It provides streams, static sound buffers and control over any number 
   of concurrent playbacks. Sample data is always stored in shared memory, 
   starting a playback simply adds an entry to the playlist of the mixer thread
   in the master application.
